Array
- You are given with an array and an integer "sum". You have to find subarray with sum value as "sum"?
- You are given an array of DISTINCT elements, rearrange the elements of array as given condition in O(n) time. The converted array should be in form a[0] < a[1] > a[2] < a[3] > a[4] < a[5] and so on... ?
- You are given with an array of size n and each value at index position i describe the hieght of the bar at that position. Calculate the total unit of water you can trap in between these bars?(assume unit of hieght of bar=1unit of water)
- You are given an array of positive and negative numbers. Find the subarray with maximum product value?(expected time complexity: O(n) & expected extra space: O(1))
- You are given an array of 0's,1's and 2's. We have to sort the array? (expected time complexity: O(n) & expected extra space: O(1))
